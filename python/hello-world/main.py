    Project Euler: #35 Circular Primes

    The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 
    197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

    There are thirteen such primes below 100: 
    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.
    
    How many circular primes are there below one million?

    Solution:

    Notes:
