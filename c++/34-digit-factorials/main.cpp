 * Project Euler: #34 Digit Factorials
 *
 * 145 is a curious number, as
 * 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
 * Find the sum of all numbers which are 
 * equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.
 * Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums, they are not included.
 *
 * Solution:
 *      nums = <145, 40585>
 *      sum = 40,730
 * 
 * Acknowledgements:
 *
 *
 * Visual Studio Code
 *      Code folding - (cmd+a), cmd+k, cmd+0
 *      Command Palette - cmd + shift + p
 *
 * Debugger:
 *      Breakpoints and for loops require two taps to proceed
 *
 * Notes:
 *      Boost Multiprecision Library
