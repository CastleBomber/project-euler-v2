Boost is newer so i will practice with this one more
GMP is fastest, so i will practice randomly




best?
GMP → best for raw performance, precision arithmetic
(but requires linking of C libraries)
Boost.Multiprecision → best for C++ integration, cleaner templates
(does not require linking to C libraries )


longer-standing?
GMP: 1991
Boost.Multiprecision: 2011


popular?
Boost: More popular overall 
Boost.Multiprecision alone is less commonly deployed.
GMP: Still the industry standard 


future?
Boost.Multiprecision is rising 
GMP will remain entrenched



GMP
